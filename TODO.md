# AgriFusion Backend - Code Comments Addition TODO

## Overview
Adding comprehensive comments to all code files to help new backend developers understand the codebase.

## Tasks

### Core Application Files
- [x] server.js - Main application entry point with Express setup, middleware, and route registration
- [ ] package.json - Dependencies and project configuration (already has basic info)

### Route Files
- [x] src/routes/farmerRoutes.js - Farmer advice endpoint routing
- [x] src/routes/marketRoutes.js - Market trends endpoint routing
- [x] src/routes/buyerRoutes.js - Buyer timing endpoint routing

### Controller Files
- [x] src/controllers/farmerController.js - Business logic for farmer advice
- [x] src/controllers/marketController.js - Business logic for market trends
- [x] src/controllers/buyerController.js - Business logic for buyer timing

### Service Files
- [x] src/services/aiService.js - OpenAI API integration for AI-powered responses
- [x] src/services/weatherService.js - Weather data service (mock implementation)
- [x] src/services/marketService.js - Market data service (mock implementation)

### Configuration Files
- [x] src/config/openaiconfig.js - OpenAI API configuration and utilities

### Utility Files
- [ ] src/utils/logger.js - Logging utilities (if exists)

## Testing
- [x] Verify application still runs after adding comments
- [x] Test all endpoints to ensure functionality preserved
  - [x] Root endpoint (/) - Returns welcome message and endpoint list
  - [x] Market trends endpoint (/api/market/trends) - Returns mock market data
  - [x] Buyer timing endpoint (/api/buyer/timing) - Returns mock timing advice
  - [x] Farmer advice endpoint (/api/farmer/advice) - Returns mock advice (fallback due to missing API key)

## Notes
- Comments should explain purpose, parameters, return values, and complex logic
- Use JSDoc format for functions where appropriate
- Keep comments clear and educational for beginners
